# Testing Instructions

## Python Implementation:
1. Open the “PythonImplementation” Folder

2. Open the file Main.py, and run the python file (no command line args needed).

3. You will have the option to test best case segments or worst-case segments, make the
appropriate selection (1 or 2) and press enter.

4. You will then have the option to enter how many line segments you would like to test. Follow
the prompts to do this correctly. Please do enter values under 1000 for reasonable runtimes,
especially when you select the average case option. Press Enter.

5. Wait for algorithm to finish, the runtime of your test should be printed, and the program should
terminate.


## Java Implementation:
1. Open the “JavaImplementation” Folder

2. Open the file Main.java and run the java file (no command line args needed).

3. Instructions are similar to python implementation; however, the java implementation can take on many more line segments than the python implementation can in a shorter amount of time. Also, after you enter the number of line segments you will like, enter the choice of what kind of implementation you want to test (tree based or array based). After pressing enter after selection the implementation, wait for algorithm to finish, the runtime of your test should be printed, and the program should terminate.
